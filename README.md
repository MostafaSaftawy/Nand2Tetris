# Nand2Tetris
This is a projects have been completed through 2 parts of nand2tetris course on coursera.

-project-1: build all the necessary gates like (And-Or-Not-Xor-MUX-DEMUX).
-project-2: use these gates to build (Half Adder- Full Adder - Up Counter - ALU ).
-project-3: build (flip-flip) then build (register) to build a (RAM) module.
-project-4: write some assembly code to be familiar with simple CPU instructions.
-project-5: build (memory) module and (CPU) module and integrate between them in one module.
-> all these modules wrote in HDL language developed by the instructors to be easy to teach.
-project-6: write an assembler in hack language which is developed by the instructor to be easy to teach.
-project-7,8: write VM Translator to implement (arihtmatic and logic commands, memory segments commands, Branching commands, and function commands).
-project-9: some application with jack language to be familiar with it.
-project-10,11: make a Compiler for jack language (Syntax analyzer, Lexical analyzer, Parser, code-generation, and handling).
-project-12:Operating System for the computer we had built through the course.
->the language called jack which is developed by the instructor to be easy to teac
